The objective of the study is to develop and deploy a mobile application capable of precisely identifying venomous and non-venomous snakes through image analysis of user-uploaded snake images. The author aims to design and evaluate the system for accuracy before its release. The primary goal of this project is to help the public at all levels, educating how to identify snakes using morphological characters/appearance, particularly individuals such as hikers, medical practitioners, and those with limited knowledge about snakes.
